# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Oasis Infobyte Internship Task 1

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The goal is to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements using supervised machine learning models.

## 📌 Objective
Predict Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

## 📈 Results
- High classification accuracy (~97%)
- Clear class separation through visualizations
